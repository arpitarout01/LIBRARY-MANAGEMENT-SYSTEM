# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

A school library management is a project that manages and stores book information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library management to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired books available in the library. It becomes necessary for schools to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue data and last date to return. Hence this system reduces manual work to a great extent and allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.
